# Mask R-CNN

This is a Pytorch implimentation of Mask R-CNN that follows [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html). This is useful for any kind of custom dataset with which you would like to perform image segmentation. The code below allows you to easily perform transfer learning using the model pre-trained on COCO train2017 provided by pytorch.

For my personal usecase, I had small dataset of 10,000 images aggregated using the reddit api wrapper, [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw). I labelled 800 of them, created this entire notebook, and was making accurate out of sample predictions within one sitting. The Dataset class below takes project files (json) generated by the [VGG image annotator](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/). For the image datset you can tweak the load_data() method as needed in order to load in your images of choice. Other than that, this notebook is plug and play and will allow you to quickly get up and running with Mask R-CNN.
